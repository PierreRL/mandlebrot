# MandleBrot Set

A simple mandlebrot set visualiser created in the javascript canvas.

To run it, simply open index.html. (You might have to wait a little second as the algorithm takes some time to finish calculating every pixel). To zoom into different parts of the set, drag a box around the location you'd like to zoom in on. Settings can be changed in the mandlebrot_generator.js file.
